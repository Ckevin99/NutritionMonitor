|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    Must have at least two HTML pages, the content displayed must be based on user input.
    The web app must run on your local computer using the test server provided by your framework

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/
    Youtube.com

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    Initially, I will try to send and receive data using Python and the front-end. By doing that, I will be more capable of understanding how it works and how I can use it in my program.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

    I will create an app to keep track how much calories, carbohydrates, proteins the user is eating over time, based on his inputs.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

    I will work in the night on wednesday and friday at home.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    I don't know so much about how Django works or the limitations that I can have, so if in the first week I don't have a plan about how I will do my application, I will look for help.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
https://github.com/Ckevin99/NutritionMonitor

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
I used a database to store the user data and I also used 3 webpages.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:
