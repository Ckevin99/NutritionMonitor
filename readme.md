## Overview

**Project Title**:

Nutrition Monitor

**Project Description**:

The app will be able to record a list of foods and their macronutrients and use this data to calculate how many calories these foods on a diet would give the user.

**Project Goals**:
My goal on this project is to understand more about how things work on the backend. I chose it because I would be able to apply what I have learned about HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and a database.
